Spidy Simulator is a software that shows how a 6 leg ant walks using Spidy
software.
Its output is dependent of Spidy's output. Spidy has a "runme" script that has
to be loaded firstly, and then executed this simulator.
Spidy Sim will open a window that will show how Spidy output will command the
real 6 leg ant.
Spidy Sim will use the pipe_sim file created by "runme" script. It's important
that static string pipeFilename in SpidySim class has to be set at right
location to find properly needed pipe.
Closing program results in quitting of program.
Enjoy it.
